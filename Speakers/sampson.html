	 <p>What's 75 million years old and
brand spanking new? A teenage
Utahceratops! Come to the
Saroyan, armed with your best
dinosaur roar, when Scott
Sampson, Research Curator at the
Utah Museum of Natural History,
steps to the podium. Sampson's
research has focused on the
ecology and evolution of late
Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has
conducted fieldwork in a number of
countries in Africa.</p>

<p>Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D.
in zoology from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on
t\,vo new species of ceratopsiÂ·ds (horned dinosaurs) from the Late
Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the groVvth and function of certopsid
horns and frills.</p>

<p>Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the
American Museum of Natural History in New York City, followed by five
years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College of
Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah
accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of
Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the
Utah Museum of Natural History. His research interests largely revolve
around the phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of Late
Cretaceous dinosaurs. </p>

<p>In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has
conducted paleontological work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and
Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was also the
on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently
completed a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life,
which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their
worlds to date</p>
